        <li><strong>Emotions:</strong></li>
      </ul>

    <p id="emotion">Uttarayan is not a festival where people are happily meeting each other and having fun; instead, it's the exact opposite of that. It is a festival where we have a competiton and battle (non-physical) with nearby kit-flyers, the main purpose of this festival is to cut others strings - a thread which is attached to the kite which helps the flyer to fly the kite, and bring down their kites.</p>
    <p id="emotions">People get very upset when one cuts down his/her kite. A victory cry is followed where a person cuts down the other kite and yells, "Kaai Po chhee".</p>
